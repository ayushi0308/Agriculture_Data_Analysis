# Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization of Agricultural Commodity Trends 

## Project Overview
This project focuses on conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) on an agricultural commodity dataset to gain insights into price distributions, production quantities, and quality grades across various regions and markets. The primary objective is to identify correlations between price variables and production quantities, supporting informed decision-making in agricultural practices.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**
  - Pandas (for data manipulation and analysis)
  - Seaborn (for statistical data visualization)
  - Matplotlib (for plotting graphs and charts)
  - Tableau (for advanced data visualization)
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis includes various agricultural commodities, with features such as:
- Commodity name
- Price
- Production quantity
- Quality grades
- Regions
- Markets

## Key Findings
- Analyzed the distribution of prices across different commodities and regions, identifying trends and outliers.
- Investigated the relationship between production quantities and prices, revealing significant correlations that can guide pricing strategies.
- Explored quality grades of commodities and their impact on pricing and market preferences.

## Visualization
Visual representations of the data were created using Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Tableau, highlighting:
- Price distribution histograms
- Scatter plots showing the correlation between production quantities and prices
- Heatmaps of price relationships across regions
